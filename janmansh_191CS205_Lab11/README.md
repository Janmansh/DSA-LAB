# Q1
 Write a program to implement the following operations on Graph(G) of Cities using the BFS algorithm.

Insert(): This function adds a node to the graph using adjacency matrix.

BFS_Display(): Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS  method.

BFS_Search():This function is  used to search for a key element in the tree and display “Search Success” in case of presence or “Search Failure” otherwise. Also display the path to the search of the key.

BFS_ Connect():Check whether a given graph is connected or not .

User appropriate parameters to the functions.

Each node contains a character type of data.
