# Q1
Linked list Implementation of a complete binary tree. The program must have the following functionalities.

Insert(): inserts a new ITEM to the complete binary tree. The items are of integer type.

Height(): returns height of a node recursively. Height (N) = MAX(Height(L), Height(R)) + 1. Here, L and R respectively represent the Left child and Right child of node N. Height of a leaf node is 0.

Preorder(): returns the preorder traversal sequence of the binary tree. Use recursive implementation.

Postorder(): returns the postorder traversal sequence of the binary tree. Use recursive implementation.

Inorder(): returns the inorder traversal sequence of the binary tree. Use recursive implementation.
