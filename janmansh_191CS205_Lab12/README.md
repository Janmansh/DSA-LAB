# Q1
Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph G, the objective is to find the minimum spanning tree G' for G using prim's algorithm

a.Initially, the tree is empty.

b.The tree starts building from a random source vertex.

c.A new vertex gets added to the tree at every step.

d.This continues till all the vertices of the graph are added to the tree.

Input:A Cost Adjacency Matrix for  graph G.

Output: Spanning tree with minimum cost .It should print the edge and its corresponding weight and finally total minimum cost.
